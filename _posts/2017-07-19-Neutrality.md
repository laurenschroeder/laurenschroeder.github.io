When it comes to international relations, an alliance is defined as a formal contingent commitment made by two or more states to some further action. A written form of the agreement is often made public to other states in the system. There are four main types of military agreements and each of them have some important differences- both the terms and outcomes of them often differ. Some lead to peace while other are actually more likely to lead to conflict.  


## Types of Military Agreement (highest to lowest):

### defense : country 1 signed a defense pact to protect country 2

### neutrality : country 1 agreed to remain neutral toward country 2

### nonaggression : country 1 promised not to attack country 2

### entente : country 1 agreed to consult with country 2 if a crisis occurred

Singer and Small (1968, 280n10) note that  neutrality and nonaggression pacts have historically had a greater impact on the international system than defense pacts.

## Comparing Military Disputes and Alliances:

Quackenbush (1) created a regression model to understand the relationship between military disputes between states and formal alliances. The coefficient between these variables (-0.5586) was negative and highly significant at a level of p < 0.001. This suggests that alliance commitment generally has a pacifying effect between allies. 

A separate model was created, analyzing military disputes as they correlate with each of the four types of alliance.

### defense : -0.3927 (p < 0.001)

### neutrality : 0.4801 (p < 0.001)

### nonaggression : -0.1733 (p < 0.01)

### entente/consultation : -0.0482 (no significant impact)

## Peace Building

As expected, defense agreements make two states significantly less likely to fight each other. Nonaggression agreements (without neutrality provisions) are more likely to lead to peace between the countries. Entente agreements didn't have a statistically significant impact on conflict.

## Neutrality Agreements

On the other hand, neutrality agreements significantly increased the likeliness of conflict. Neutrality provisions are the least common type of provision and seem to be included in alliances only when there's reason to believe that an ally may not remain neutral in a future conflict.

For example, the Simla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan in 1972 in order to "put an end to the conflict and confrontation that have hitherto marred their relations". Despite the agreement, the countries experiences armed conflict, most recently in the Kargil War of 1999 (3).

To look at more examples of international neutrality agreements throughout history, take a look at a visualization I made <a href="https://laurenschroeder.github.io/alliances/">here</a>.

Overall, allied states see less conflict but the results depend more on the specific agreements of the alliance. Nonagression and defense agreements show decreased conflict in the future but neutrality provisions tend to correlate with future conflict. As counterintuitive as this seems, many times neutrality pacts are just a band-aid for a deep-rooted conflict.


## The Dataset:

These formalized alliances are tracked and compiled into a dataset that can be used by alliance theory researchers (2). There are also many informal alliances and trade agreements that are imperative to international relationships but that are omitted from this dataset which consists only of military agreements. 

The highest level of agreement between two states in any given year was recorded.
