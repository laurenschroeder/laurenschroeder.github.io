In looking at pairs of states (dyads) that engage in conflict and have held neutrality pacts, at first glance it's clear what many of them have in common - they're from the same continent. On closer inspection, it's clear that many of these countries also are contiguous, meaning they share a border.

By nature, borders are territorial and sovereign states are territorial units. Contiguity was found to be the factory that increases the chances of conflict between two states the most (73) [1]. There are several reasons for this. The proximity leads to more interactions - both cooporation and conflict. There's more opportunity for conflict to arise, and if it does, the proximity makes a military invasion easier to accomplish since transporting military resources over large distances uses up a great number of resources.

For example, the US and Mexico share a border, and it was conflict over this border that spurred the Mexico-American war in 1856. In 1845 the US took control of the quasi-independant Republic of Texas.

The "Mexico-American War": What Does Mexico Call It?

The "Mexico-American War" was the name given to the territorial dispute between the US and Mexico. At the time the US claimed that Mexico had waged war on the US. In order to gain American support for the war, it had to look like the US was defending land from a Mexican attack. As the US drove into disputed land around the border, people in Mexico became nervous.

A Mexican man looking to learn more about what was going on may have picked up a copy of the daily "El Tiempo" which described the way the US was pushing into this disputed territory. His thoughts may have been redirected to fears his country becoming overpowered by the American government. How could his country let themselves be overrun by this force which the article described as a 'bandit who came upon a traveler'?

What the Americans considered to be a war declared by Mexico, the Mexicans considered it to be the defense of their territorial rights. President Mariano Paredes enacted the Congressional decree that stated:

Article 1. The government, in the natural defense of the nation, will repel the aggression initiated and sustained by the United States of America against the Republic of Mexico, having invaded and committed hostilities in a number of the departments making up Mexican territory.
Article 3. The government will communicate to friendly nations and to the entire republic the justifiable causes which obliged it to defend its rights, left with no other choice but to repel force with force, in response to the violent aggression committed by the United States


*Basically, this was not a war but defense. While Americans refer to the 'Mexico-American War', Mexico calls it the "U.S. Invasion".*

To look at examples of international conflict neutrality agreements throughout history, take a look at a visualization I made <a href="https://laurenschroeder.github.io/alliances/">here</a>. Note the amount of conflict and agreements between bordering states.
