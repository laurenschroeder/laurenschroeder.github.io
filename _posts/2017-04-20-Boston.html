title: BPS Capacity Analysis
---
Boston public schools are currently formulating a plan to renovate and expand public schools buildings. Different schools have different needs and the community needs a long term lan to effectively allocate resources throughout BPS and ensure that student success remains the highest priority.

Capacity Models - Understanding
I chose to conceptualize the idea of capacity by first defining it using an infographic. I built simple graphics to quickly show the concepts behind the two models: current use capacity is based on seats filled while 21st century capacity is based on space available to do various activies and programs such as art or sports.
</br></br>
Increasing offerings—core
curriculum, enrichment
programs, or CVTE—will
increase the number of
teaching spaces needed
in the schools. In some
cases, spaces for those new
offerings will be general
education classrooms; in
others, additional specialty
classrooms and labs will
be required.
</br></br>
The Ten Year Cost Model
</br></br>
The BuildBPS 10 year FMP cost model was created using the data from facility and educational effectiveness assessments. Market conditions and historical cost data was used to estimate the estimated cost for each building. These are rough estimates, and in representing them, it is important that people don't get hung up on small differences between project costs; they should serve as an 'order of magnitude' to use when comparing projects.
</br></br>
Costs are grouped by repairs and renovations. Repairs refer to the costs to repair items categorized as fair, poor, or deficient. </br></br>
The 21st Century Educational Capacity Model represents
a more holistic understanding of space needs and learning
environments in the district. The State has developed a series
of educational space standards for new construction that
represent one perspective on what spaces and how much
space is needed for 21st Century Learning. It accounts for
additional spaces such as enrichment programs, specialty
subjects (e.g. art and music), dedicated spaces for counseling
and therapies, and other supports that will transform our
schools and activate the learning and teaching experiences of
the future.
