title: "4x4 Model of Knowledge Content"

### The 4x4 Model helps to deliver content in *layers* in order to get the best content to people at the right time. It was developed by Bill Shander, CEO and founder of Beehive Media.

I decided to use this method in devloping a story around formal alliance data "International Military Alliances".

The inaugural title in the Correlates of War series from CQ Press, this 2-volume set catalogs every official interstate alliance signed from the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 through the early twenty-first century, ranking it among the most thorough and accessible reviews of formal military treaties ever published.

## 1. The Watercooler

Watercooler content is made up of short, attention grabbing snippets of information. It gives context and it's the content that people will look at to decide whether or not to spend more time learning about the topic. 

Example: A headline of an article.

Time: Very short (seconds)

## 2. The Cafe

If someone's interest is piqued, they may want to watch a short video on the topic, or read a short article. This is cafe content. It's still light and interesting and will also help people evaluate if they want to delve deeper into learning.

Example: 750-word blog post, graph

Time: A few minutes

## 3. The Research Library

This is where someone will spend large amounts of time researching a topic. It may be through reading a book or watching a longer video.

Example: 50 page PDF report

Time: Mins/Hours

## 4. The Lab

After learning more about the topic, people may want to explore the underlying data themselves in order to draw new conclusions and explore. In making the data and sources available, people can use them as needed.

Example: Data used to create graphs

Time: Mins/Hours

Introduction:

An alliance is defined as a formal contingent commitment made by two or more states to some further action. A written form of the agreement is often made public to other states in the system. These formalized alliances are tracked and compiled into a dataset that can be used by alliance theory researchers. There are also many informal alliances and trade agreements that are imperative to international relationships but that are omitted from this dataset which consists only of military agreements. 

The highest level of agreement between two states in any given year was recorded.

## Types of Military Agreement (highest to lowest):

defense : country 1 signed a defense pact to protect country 2
neutrality : country 1 agreed to remain neutral toward country 2
nonaggression : country 1 promised not to attack country 2
entente : country 1 agreed to consult with country 2 if a crisis occurred

Singer and Small (1968, 280n10) note that  neutrality and nonaggression pacts have historically had a greater impact on the international system than defense pacts.
