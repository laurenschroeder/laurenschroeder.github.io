title: "4x4 Model of Knowledge Content"

When telling a story with data, it's important to understand how much information to share to which audience. I was recently talking to some data science students about Twitter and one of them mentioned some people to follow for interesting articles about data science. One of the first thoughts that popped into my head was that more options for articles is the last thing I need. In having multiple email subscriptions and pages I follow, it can seem like there's too much information available. In order to get people interested in your particular content, they need to be introduced to it in a quick fun way before having to read a lengthy article.

## The 4x4 Model helps to deliver content in *layers* in order to get the best content to people at the right time. It was developed by Bill Shander, CEO and founder of Beehive Media.

I decided to use this method in devloping a story around formal alliance data "International Military Alliances" (1). This dataset catalogues every international alliance since 1816. The steps are as follows:

## 1. The Watercooler

Watercooler content is made up of short, attention grabbing snippets of information. It gives context and it's the content that people will look at to decide whether or not to spend more time learning about the topic. 

Example: A headline of an article.  

Time: Very short (seconds)  

Possible Topics for Military Alliance story:  

1. Why countries are more likely to have military alliances with neighbors.  
2. The 4 types of alliance and how they affect peace.  
3. Military alliances - Conflict and Peace.  
4. The neutrality pact could be a good predictor of future conflict  


Then taking the concept and changing into into a headline: 

1. Keep Your Friends Close, but Your Enemies Closer  
2. Agreeing to Disagree - Conflict Countries  
3. Alliances: not all created equal  
4. Neutral on the dotted line, conflict at the border  



## 2. The Cafe

If someone's interest is piqued, they may want to watch a short video on the topic, or read a short article. This is cafe content. It's still light and interesting and will also help people evaluate if they want to delve deeper into learning.

Example: Graph, blog post

Time: A few minutes

Alliance Example: I decided to create a <a href="https://laurenschroeder.github.io/alliances/"> visualization</a> to accompany the information as something simple and interesting that people can use to explore the data. The purpose is to be able to investigate specific countries and continents that form neutrality pacts. By looking at the year they were formed, users could delve deeper into learning about specific alliances.

The initial graphic shows only these alliances but as a next step I'd like to join some military conflict data to the visualization to show the relationship between neutrality pacts and conflict.

Another example of this would be the blog post I created<a href="https://laurenschroeder.github.io/2017-07-19-Neutrality.html"> here</a>. It gives an overview of alliance types and outcomes.  


## 3. The Research Library

This is where someone will spend large amounts of time researching a topic. It may be through reading a book or watching a longer video.

Example: 50 page PDF report

Time: Mins/Hours

Alliance example: This could be individual research someone does on a specific neutrality agreement or reading a referenced publication by Douglas Gibler.


## 4. The Lab

After learning more about the topic, people may want to explore the underlying data themselves in order to draw new conclusions and explore. In making the data and sources available, people can use them as needed.

Example: Data used to create graphs

Alliance example: Some sources I cited could be used to learn more about the topic and evaluate the raw data.

Time: Mins/Hours  

### By keeping content catchy and short, people will be more likely to check out the content and learn about the message. At this point, they can choose whether or not to delve deeper into the topic.
