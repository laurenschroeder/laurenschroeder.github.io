Superintendant Tommy Chang:
 Our students, families, and staff deserve a long
term plan that sets forth a strategic approach on how to effectively
allocate resources throughout BPS to ensure that student success
remains the highest priority. 

Increasing offerings—core
curriculum, enrichment
programs, or CVTE—will
increase the number of
teaching spaces needed
in the schools. In some
cases, spaces for those new
offerings will be general
education classrooms; in
others, additional specialty
classrooms and labs will
be required.

The Ten Year Cost Model

The BuildBPS 10 year FMP cost model was created using the data from facility and educational effectiveness assessments. Market conditions and historical cost data was used to estimate the estimated cost for each building. These are rough estimates, and in representing them, it is important that people don't get hung up on small differences between project costs; they should serve as an 'order of magnitude' to use when comparing projects.

Costs are grouped by repairs and renovations. Repairs refer to the costs to repair items categorized as fair, poor, or deficient.
