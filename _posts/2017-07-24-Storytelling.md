It's not an accident that stories are a fundamental part of all human societies. They're a way for humans to learn more about how to confront anxiety and fulfil an outcome.

Every story contains actionable items and is embedded with emotional triggers. An good story will both grab someones attention and provide some type of conlusive outcome.

## Exclaim & Explain

Try starting your story with a question. The question could be explicit or implicit in the title -hook the reader in so they want to know more- and lead the reader to their answer through a story.

## Emotion

Emotion is an important part of storytelling. Hearing about the experiences of 2000 people is very abstract, but hearing the details (actions, sensory and emotional experiences) of an individual is much more relatable. An idea can be expressed more effectively with an emotional story instead of showing a chart with cumulative human experience.

## Storyboarding an Emotional Story 

My post "The "Mexico-American War": What Does Mexico Call It?" was made with this type of storyboarding techniques and can be seen <a href="https://laurenschroeder.github.io/2017/07/25/Invasion.html">here</a>.
