  <h4>As schools are being evaluated for renovation, we need to prioritize which schools should be renovated and expanded first. When basing these decisions on demand and need, there's a few important factors that need to be considered. Not only do different neighborhoods show different capacity levels, certain neighborhoods are expected to grow at faster rates in the near future. By understanding these demands, we can make fair, educated decisions related to BPS school expansion.</h4>

Only 21% of Boston schools have 'fair' science learning environments. Over half of schools don't have existing space that can be used for music classes.
